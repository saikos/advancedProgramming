# Implementation of the Javascript Promise in Java

You can find a "skeleton" of the `Promise` class in 
the `lib/src/main/java/gr/uoa/di/promise/Promise.java` file.

What you need to do:

1. "Complete" the implementation of this class.
2. Ensure that your implementation passes all the tests contained in the `lib/src/test/groovy/gr/uoa/di/promise/PromiseSpec.groovy` file.

To verify that your implementation compiles and passes the tests, invoke the following command from the project root directory:

```
> ./gradlew build
```

or 

```
> ./gradlew test
```

After each execution, you can find the test reports in the `lib/build/reports/tests/test/index.html` file.
